This was mozilla\'s decision, and there is nothing we can do about it. We are therefore limited to the tools the WebExtensions model provides to us, which sadly makes it impossible to provide some of the advanced features of DownThemAll! Version 3. Furthermore there are some bugs in Firefox that affect DownThemAll! as well, e.g. downloads will always succeed even if the server returns an error, but I fixed this in upcoming Firefox 71.\nHowever, we\'re still able to provide the advanced selection, queuing, file naming options of the old DownThemAll! and a lot more.'",extension,"Nils Maier",mozilla

Proxies can be switched by:\n\n1. point-and-click of colored icons in a popup menu\n2. URL - define URL patterns with wildcards or regular expressions\n3. browser tab - set individual proxies per tab!\n4. Firefox container or Private Browsing windows - define different proxies for each container\n\n<strong>SOME FEATURES</strong>\n<ul><li>Automatically switch proxy by: browser tab, URL patterns, firefox container, private browsing window, or manually select from a drop-down list</li><li>Customize colors and country flags to make it easy to see which proxy is in use</li><li>Import/Export all of your settings, or just URL patterns, to share with others. Optionally synchronize proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync.</li><li>Keyboard shortcuts to quickly switch proxies and perform other actions</li><li>Turn WebRTC on/off to further limit discovery of your IP address</li><li>Quick-Add to quickly add new URL patterns to proxy settings</li><li>Globally exclude any website from all proxying</li><li>Built-in pattern tester to test and debug your URL patterns</li><li>Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when so you can debug problems</li><li>Extensive built-in help</li></ul>\n<strong>PERMISSIONS</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>downloads</strong>: Required to export the extension settings to a file. Users can import that file to other Chrome/Firefox instances, or share it with colleagues, in order to keep the same settings. It can also be backed up and used later.</li><li><strong>proxy</strong>: The core function of the extension is to allow users to set the proxy server used by the browser.</li><li><strong>storage</strong>: Required to store proxy server settings (hostname, port, username, and which proxy server is enabled by the user)</li><li><strong>tabs</strong>: Required so that users can set separate proxies to use per tab.

Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology  \xe2\x80\x93 called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection \xe2\x80\x93 goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.</li><li><i>Automatically Enforce Encryption</i> \xe2\x80\x94 force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.</li><li><i>Enable Built-in Email Protection</i> \xe2\x80\x94 Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you\xe2\x80\x99ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.</li><li><i>Escape Fingerprinting</i> \xe2\x80\x94 help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings. </li><li><i>Block Tracking Cookies</i>\xe2\x80\x94 prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.</li></ul>\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n<ul><li><i>Link Tracking Protection</i> \xe2\x80\x94 helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.</li><li><i>Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection</i> \xe2\x80\x94 blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can\'t track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.</li><li><i>Google AMP Protection</i> \xe2\x80\x94 forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.</li><li><i>Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC)</i> \xe2\x80\x94 built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information.

403061,https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildboost,b'BuildBoost',"b'<p><a href="http://www.buildboost.org" rel="nofollow">BuildBoost</a> is an open build framework with minimal-to-zero configuration that allows you to set up builds for Eclipse plugins and Eclipse update site deployments within minutes. BuildBoost is a Java/Ant-based framework and meta-build tool that rigorously follows the concept of \'convention over configuration\' to enable minimal-to-zero build configurations. For this, it is based on the principle that all information needed to build an artefact is delivered with the artifact itself and must not be hidden in build scripts. Furthermore, in BuildBoost the build system itself is considered part of the software and thus BuildBoost includes a bootstrap concept that builds the build system itself with the software. This allows a continuous and agile development of the build system itself together with the software system. BuildBoost is a highly extendable framework.

It is integrated into Eclipse through the Eclipse Project file preventing you from writing a single line of custom compile script code. It accelerates builds, relieves congestion and gathers critical dependency information that is used to package binaries for deployment success. OpenMake Meister can improve the functionality of any Continuous Build process such as Jenkins by off loading overworked CI workflows.  Meister includes Server Pooling for distributing CI workloads and supports over 10,000 builds per day on a single Meister Engine.  Meister is unique in that It gives you full control over the logic that drives your compile and link process through the use of compile playbooks we call 'Build Services.'  It accelerates full builds by over 50% and supports accurate incremental builds needed by agile practices.  Out of the box,  Meister supports over 200 languages including Java, .Net, C#, C, C++, and database objects and can be extended by the user. </p>\n<p>Manage Smaller Builds and Decrease Risk</p>\n<p>Meister gives you the intelligence to manage your builds and releases in smaller, less risky increments. Through source and library dependency management, Meister allows you to build for incremental releases. With Meister, agile teams can achieve 10-minute-or-less incremental builds for most projects, ensuring that continuous integration and unit testing runs smoothly and efficiently for maximum benefit. Incremental processing is supported in most languages, including Java, C#, .Net, C++, and C-Unix.</p>\n<p>Intelligent Control Over Low-Level Tasks</p>\n<p>Meister is the only solution that gives you intelligent control over the low-level logic that is critical to driving your software compiles.  Other Build solutions rely on one-off script-driven processes that impede the hand-off of operational tasks between development teams and IT operations. With Meister your build process becomes both highly repeatable and 100% predictable through a high-level of standardization and control. </p>\n<p>Accelerated Builds</p>\n<p>By directing, calculating, and managing software dependencies, Meister accelerates software compile/link activity and reduces build times by over 50%.  Compile speeds enable teams to implement agile and fast-moving development processes. Builds are accelerated using parallel processing to multi-task compilers and linkers, taking full advantage of separate processors on multi-core machine hardware. </p>\n<p>Insight Into DevOps</p>\n<p>Meister provides team leads and managers with actionable build analytics, including summarized \xe2\x80\x9csuccess/fail\xe2\x80\x9d reports, impact analysis reports, and audit reports, enabling better software development decision-making. Meister Insight Reports document the dependencies, environment, and other critical information about a build or release. Managers can ask and answer important questions around the impact of specific code changes to drive accurate test and release practices. Meister can even embed footprint data in binaries, enabling teams to simplify the software support and maintenance process by accurately identifying the contents and origin of any software release.</p>\n<p>Enterprise Scalability and Cross-Platform Support</p>\n<p>Out of the box, Meister supports most popular languages running on cross platforms. Meister supports the building of cross platform and cross language applications including z/OS. Meister can be extended and can execute any existing script. </p>\n<p>Build Inside or Outside of Your IDE</p>\n<p>Meister integrates with IDEs, such as Eclipse, to repeat the IDE build outside of the IDE. This repeatability supports continuous integration builds, QA builds, and pre-production builds without the need for writing custom build scripts that often become out of sync with the IDE project and solution files. This repeatability allows developers to work inside their IDE without changing their work habits and simultaneously to build their software application outside the IDE consistently and in a predictable manner.</p>"",resource,"Tracy Ragan",eclipse

593,https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jdeodorant,b'JDeodorant',"b'<p>JDeodorant is an Eclipse plug-in that identifies design problems in software, known as bad smells, and resolves them by applying appropriate refactorings.</p>\n<p>JDeodorant employs a variety of novel methods and techniques in order to identify code smells and suggest the appropriate refactorings that resolve them. For the moment, the tool identifies five kinds of bad smells, namely <strong>Feature Envy</strong>, <strong>Type Checking</strong>, <strong>Long Method</strong>, <strong>God Class</strong> and <strong>Duplicated Code</strong>.</p>\n<p>Feature Envy problems are resolved by appropriate <em>Move Method</em> refactorings. Type Checking problems are resolved by appropriate <em>Replace Conditional with Polymorphism</em> and <em>Replace Type code with State/Strategy</em> refactorings. Long Method problems are resolved by appropriate <em>Extract Method</em> refactorings. God Class problems are resolved by appropriate <em>Extract Class</em> refactorings. Duplicated Code problems are resolved by appropriate <em>Extract Clone</em> refactorings.</p>\n<p>The tool is the outcome of the research performed in the <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~nikolaos/" rel="nofollow">Software Refactoring Lab</a> Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Canada and the <a href="http://se.uom.gr/" rel="nofollow">Software Engineering Group</a> at the Department of Applied Informatics, University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece.</p>\n<p>JDeodorant encompasses a number of innovative features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transformation of expert knowledge to fully automated processes</li>\n<li>Pre-Evaluation of the effect for each suggested solution</li>\n<li>User guidance in comprehending the design problems</li>\n<li>User friendliness (one-click approach in improving design quality)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp-NaYVqKOERLreXxwCgWzg" rel="nofollow">JDeodorant YouTube Channel</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WPtgG6JwJ8" rel="nofollow">Refactoring of the Clones - Teaser Trailer</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtH8uF0epV0" rel="nofollow">Code Smell Visualization Demo</a></p>\n<p><strong>Latest features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/tsantalis/JDeodorant/releases" rel="nofollow">JDeodorant Release Information on GitHub</a></li>\n<li>[11/11/2016] Bug fixes and improvements: - Extract Class Refactoring implementation tested with <strong>1475 refactorings</strong> applied in JFreeChart-1.0.19 and <strong>1149 refactorings</strong> applied in JFreeChart-1.0.10 - Move Method Refactoring implementation tested with <strong>99 refactorings</strong> applied in JFreeChart-1.0.19 and <strong>65 refactorings</strong> applied in JFreeChart-1.0.10 - Extract Class and Move Method candidate refactorings are no longer virtually applied. <strong>This makes the detection of refactoring opportunities much faster</strong>. - Redundant Extract Method refactoring opportunities are no longer reported by eliminating identical slices expanding in different blocks.</li>\n<li>[12/09/2016] Bug fixes and improvements in the Move Method Refactoring implementation.</li>\n<li>[29/08/2016] Bug fixes and improvements in the Clone Refactoring feature.</li>\n<li>[14/06/2016] Proper creation of incoming control dependence for Try statements without resources.</li>\n<li>[11/06/2016] Bug fixes and improvements: - Fixed the check for unprocessed methods in call graph analysis. - Fixed an infinite loop in call graph analysis. - TypeSearchRequestor excludes anonymous types from the results when searching for subclass types.</li>\n<li>[09/06/2016] Bug fixes and improvements: - Improved the detection of method declarations with a type parameter from method invocations. - Fixed a common bug in Extract Class and Move Method refactorings related to Enums. - Refactored the common logic for finding topics to class TopicFinder. - Added a right-click pop-up menu to show the code smell visualization on user demand. - Added a check box for the filtering of clone groups based on the Java files currently opened in the editor.</li>\n<li>[06/04/2016] Extended method call analysis to class instance creations and constructor invocations.</li>\n<li>[22/02/2016] Fixed all the bugs reported for <strong>Type-Checking</strong> related refactorings in the paper by Francesca Arcelli Fontana, Marco Mangiacavalli, Domenico Pochiero, and Marco Zanoni titled <strong>On experimenting refactoring tools to remove code smells</strong>.

Special thanks to Marco Mangiacavalli for the detailed report he prepared.</li>\n<li>[01/02/2016] Improved the performance of method call analyzer. If the type of the reference through which a polymorphic method is called can be statically determined, then only the overriding implementation of the subclass type corresponding to the reference type is analyzed.</li>\n<li>[21/01/2016] - Improved the views for Feature Envy, God Class, Long Method, Type-Checking by allowing the user to apply refactoring opportunities on the currently examined project, even if the user has selected another project in between. The active project is always the last project on which a detection of code smells has been performed. - If the user has opened multiple code smell views, and each one of them contains refactoring opportunities for a different project, then a change to one of the projects will disable the "Apply Refactoring" button only for the code smell view corresponding to the changed project.</li>\n<li>[15/01/2016] The Extract Method refactoring opportunities in which the statement declaring the variable criterion is nested in a deeper level compared to the level in which the extracted method invocation will be placed (i.e., the level in which the first statement of the slice is nested) are automatically excluded from being reported.</li>\n<li>[08/01/2016] - The project is always being built before getting parsed. AST parsing takes place only if there are no compilation errors. - Files generated by Parser generators are automatically skipped from the analysis for refactoring opportunities. Currently, JavaCC, ANTLR, JFlex, and CUP generators are supported.</li>\n<li>[29/12/2015] Fixed all the bugs reported for <strong>Extract Class Refactoring</strong> in the paper by Francesca Arcelli Fontana, Marco Mangiacavalli, Domenico Pochiero, and Marco Zanoni titled <strong>On experimenting refactoring tools to remove code smells</strong>. Special thanks to Marco Mangiacavalli for the detailed report he prepared.</li>\n<li>[14/12/2015] Improved the handling of block nested within control statements in the generation of the Program Dependence Graph.</li>\n<li>[12/12/2015] Improved the clone statement mapping process to prevent the mapping of statements being nested in the same level, but belonging to different basic blocks.</li>\n<li>[06/12/2015] Methods belonging to test classes are no longer reported as refactoring opportunities for Feature Envy. Fixed a bug occurring when the user is switching between the Duplicated Code view containing imported clones belonging to project X and the Refactoring of duplicated methods selected in the Package Explorer belonging to project Y.</li>\n<li>[23/11/2015] The repeated clone groups and class-level clones are no longer stored in memory.</li>\n<li>[20/11/2015] The Duplicated Code view is updated after a refactoring or any other source code edit to highlight the eliminated, edited, and shifted clones. In this way the user does not have to import new clone detection results after the application of a clone refactoring.</li>\n<li>[03/11/2015] The import of clone detection results has become faster by disabling the resolution of bindings when configuring the JDT ASTParser.</li>\n<li>[27/10/2015] Fixed NullPointerException taking place when the default constructor is called, but no such constructor declaration exists in the actual source code.</li>\n<li>[20/10/2015] Bug fix in the parser for CCFinder clone detection results file.</li>\n<li>[17/10/2015] Added a <strong>Clone Import Wizard</strong> supporting the import of clones from 5 popular clone detection tools, namely CCFinder, ConQAT, Deckard, NiCad, and CloneDR. To use this feature go to Bad Smells -&gt; Duplicated Code. This will open the "Duplicated Code" view for displaying the imported clone groups. Next, select a Java project from the Package Explorer, and click on the "Import Clones" button of the view.</li>\n<li>[19/09/2015] Tons of bug fixes in Extract Clone Refactoring.</li>\n<li>[20/08/2015] - Updated the detection of type-check elimination opportunities to support state variables having java.lang.String as type. - Fixed the case where the classes of the inheritance hierarchy belong to the same CompilationUnit with the code performing the Runtime Type Identification (bug reported by jasyn). - Tons of bug fixes in Extract Clone Refactoring.</li>\n<li>[28/05/2015] The files containing the clones are opened in the editor before refactoring to avoid problems in the Undo history when applying successive Extract Clone refactorings.</li>\n<li>[22/05/2015] Several bug fixes in Extract Clone Refactoring.</li>\n<li>[07/05/2015] Fixed the refactoring of an if/else matched with a conditional expression (ternary operator).</li>\n<li>[30/04/2015] - Excluded interfaces Serializable, Runnable, and Comparable from the list of accepted common super types. - Improved the matching of variable declaration statements with assignment statements.</li>\n<li>[22/04/2015] Extended method commonSuperType() in class ASTNodeMatcher to find also the common superInterface of two types (if there is no common superclass).</li>\n<li>[16/04/2015] Improved precondition for the parameterization of differences to ignore incoming dependencies from advanced matched nodes.</li>\n<li>[26/03/2015] <strong>The first stable version of the Control Structure Variant Clone Visualization and Refactoring feature is released</strong>.</li>\n<li>[24/12/2014] - Fixed Extract Class Refactoring to make the extracted class implement the Serializable interface, if the source class implements the Serializable interface and at least one extracted field is non-transient. - Fixed the extraction of thrown exceptions in PDG nodes. Class Instance Creations throwing exceptions are also taken into account in addition to method invocations. - Added support for checking whether a method with the same name already exists in a class when performing an Extract Method Refactoring. - Fixed a bug related to the handling of Synchronized blocks during the generation of the PDG.</li>\n<li>[25/10/2014] - The updating of the model is no longer performed asynchronously. This bug caused model inconsistencies when detecting refactoring opportunities in the new code elements introduced by a previously applied refactoring. - Added vertical scrolling to the Slice Profile table. - Added support for collecting comments (i.e., line, block, and javadoc comments) - Fixed the refactoring of clones already containing parameters with argN names (where N is an integer starting from 0) - Fixed a bug in the Extract Method Refactoring mechanics</li>\n<li>[21/09/2014] Updated the slice-profile view to display all local variables declared inside the body of the examined method. Added an option that enables only the variables with a scope covering the entire method body.</li>\n<li>[10/09/2014] Fixed the refactoring of clones with additionally matched statements coming from the advanced matching of control predicate statements.</li>\n<li>[06/09/2014] Added support for the advanced matching of a VariableDeclaration statement having an initializer with a VariableDeclaration statement not having an initializer + an Assignment statement initializing the declared variable.

LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a.

This makes it easy to browse or monitor multiple web pages, or to compare multiple web pages using synchronized scroll.  Layouts can be saved and later re-opened.\n\nTile Tabs WE is implemented using the WebExtensions API and is available for both Firefox and Chrome with identical functions and user interfaces.\n\nBASIC OPERATION\n\nTile Tabs WE emulates \'split browser\' functionality with simple switching between the normal view and the tiled view.\n\nTile Tabs WE displays multiple tabs in a layout of tiled sub-windows (\'tiles\') within the area of the parent browser window. The tiles can be arranged horizontally, vertically, or in a grid.\n\nA tiled layout can be created using the toolbar button, button menu, context menu, quick menu, or keyboard shortcuts. The parent window is indicated by a badge on the toolbar button showing the current number of tiles. Tiles are indicated by a badge on their toolbar buttons showing the letter \'T\'.\n\nWhen a tiled layout is created, tabs from the parent window are moved into the new tiles in the following order: first the selected tab, then tabs to the right of the selected tab, then tabs to the left of the selected tab, and finally if there are insufficient tabs then new tabs will be created.\n\nA tiled layout can be saved and previously saved layouts can be opened or deleted. A default layout can be configured.\n\nDragging the borders between two tiles will resize both tiles (and any sub-tiles).\n\nOPTIONS PAGE\n\nThe Tile Tabs WE Options page can be accessed as follows:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Firefox - On the menu bar select Tools &gt; Add-ons (or press Ctrl+Shift+A), select the Extensions tab, and then click on the Options button.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Chrome - Right-click on the toolbar button, and then select Options.\n\nTOOLBAR BUTTON\n\nAfter installation of Tile Tabs WE, there will be a new blue \'tiled-layout\' button on the main toolbar.\n\nTo create a new tiled layout, click on the Tile Tabs WE toolbar button.\n\nTo switch between the tiled view and the normal view, click on the Tile Tabs WE toolbar button again.\n\nCONTEXT MENU &amp; BUTTON MENU\n\nTo perform any layout or tiling operation, right-click on the page contents to open the context menu, select the \'Tile Tabs WE\' sub-menu, and then select one of the menu items:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 New Layout - creates a new layout and moves one tab from the parent window into each tile.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Close Layout - closes the existing layout and moves tabs from all tiles back into the parent window.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hide Layout - hides the existing layout and moves tabs from all tiles back into the parent window.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Show Layout - shows the existing layout and moves one tab from the parent window into each tile.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Refresh Layout - brings all of the tiles to the front and focuses one of the tiles.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Toggle Toolbars - toggles the tab bar and address bar in the currently focused tile or all tiles.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tile Tab - tiles a tab above, below, left or right of the currently focused tile or creates a new layout.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Add Tile - adds a new tile (with a new tab) above, below, left or right of the currently focused tile.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Remove Tile - removes the currently focused tile and expands the other tiles as necessary.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Expand Tile - expands the currently focused tile to the full size of the layout.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Contract Tile - contracts the currently focused tile back to its original size.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Equalize Tiles - equalizes the sizes of the currently focused tile and other tiles in the same group.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Bookmark Layout - saves the current layout as a browser bookmark.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Open Layout - opens a previously saved layout and assigns the saved tabs (if any) to the tiles.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Save Layout - saves the current layout and optionally the tabs, scroll positions and zoom levels.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Delete Layouts - deletes previously saved layouts.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Default Layout - sets the default layout to be one of the previously saved layouts.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Scroll Lock - enables/disables the scroll lock for the currently focused tile.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sync Scroll - enables/disables synchronized scrolling of tiled tab contents.\n\nOr right-click on any tab to open the tab context menu and use the \'Tile Tab\' menu item to create a new layout.\n\nAlternatively, right-click on the Tile Tabs WE toolbar button to open the button menu, and then select one of the menu items.\n\nThere are options to:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 define the default page for new tabs created by New Layout or Add Tile.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 show/hide the Tile Tabs WE submenu item on the context menu.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 show tabs in all windows (or just parent and tiled windows) on Tile Tab submenu. \n\xe2\x80\xa2 show/hide the toolbars for new tiles created by New Layout or Add Tile.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 open the default layout on browser start and restart.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 reload pages in tiled tabs during Refresh Layout.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 synchronize scroll only when scrolling the focused window.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 delay setting of saved scroll positions when opening saved layouts.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 delay setting of saved zoom levels when opening saved layouts.\n\nQUICK MENU\n\nTo provide quicker access to frequently used commands, a small Quick Menu icon is displayed in the top-left corner of the page contents of each tile. The Quick Menu is especially useful when the toolbars are hidden or when the Tile Tabs WE toolbar button has overflowed off the toolbar.\n\nTo perform frequently used commands, hover the mouse over the Quick Menu icon, and then select one of the available commands:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Close Layout\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hide Layout\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Refresh Layout\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Toggle (This Tile or All Tiles)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Bookmark Layout\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Save Layout\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sync Scroll\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Add Tile (Above, Left, Right or Below)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Remove Tile\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Expand Tile\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Contract Tile\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Equalize Tiles\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Scroll Lock\n\nNote, the Quick Menu icon is not displayed in some special pages (e.g. about: or chrome://...).\n\nThere are options to show/hide the Quick Menu icon in all tiles and to position the Quick Menu icon in any corner of a tiled tab.\n\nKEYBOARD SHORTCUTS\n\nTo perform the most frequently used operations, press one of the four keyboard shortcuts:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 New/Close Layout - Alt+Shift+Up (Windows and Linux) or Control+Shift+Up (Mac OS X)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hide/Show Layout - Alt+Shift+Down (Windows and Linux) or Control+Shift+Down (Mac OS X)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Refresh Layout - Alt+Shift+Left (Windows and Linux) or Control+Shift+Left (Mac OS X)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Toggle Toolbars - Alt+Shift+Right (Windows and Linux) or Control+Shift+Right (Mac OS X)\n\nThese shortcuts can be reconfigured in the Shortcuts tab of the Tile Tabs WE Options page.\n\nThere is an option to set the Toggle Toolbars keyboard shortcut to toggle all toolbars.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF TABS TO TILES\n\nThere a several different ways of assigning tabs to tiles.\n\nIf there is only one tab selected, then creating a new layout will assign the selected tab and tabs to the right of the selected tab to the tiles in the layout. If there are not enough tabs to the right, then additional tabs will be assigned from the left of the selected tab. If there are still not enough tabs, then new tabs will be created and assigned.\n\nIf the new layout is an \'All Tabs\' layout, then all of the existing tabs will be assigned to tiles.\n\nIf the Tile Tab menu command is used to create a layout, the selected tab and the tab chosen by the Tile Tab menu command will be assigned.\n\nIf multiple tabs are highlighted using Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click, the highlighted tabs (including the normal selected tab) will be assigned to the tiles.

726880,https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/print-edit-we/,"b'Print Edit WE'","b'CHANGES\n\nVersion 29.6  <i>(awaiting release)</i>\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 New option to prevent font ligatures inside text (enabled by default).\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nPrint Edit WE provides facilities to edit the contents of a web page prior to printing or saving as HTML or PDF. Elements in the web page can be formatted, hidden or deleted and text can be edited or inserted. Unwanted content, such as adverts and sidebars, can easily be removed.\n\nNote, to use the Save As HTML feature, the Save Page WE extension (version 14.0 or later) must be installed and enabled.\n\nBASIC OPERATION\n\nTo start editing the page, click on the Print Edit WE button on the main toolbar, or select Print Edit WE &gt; Start Editing on the context menu. A blue \'EDIT\' (editing) badge will appear on the button.\n\nThe \'Web Style\' feature is disabled by default, so that the page displayed looks similar to how the page would look if printed normally. When the \'Web Style\' feature is enabled, the page displayed will look similar to how the page looks during normal browsing.\n\nThe \'Text Pieces\' feature is disabled by default, so that only whole blocks of text can be selected. When the \'Text Pieces\' feature is enabled, individual pieces of text can be selected and edited and line breaks are displayed.\n\nThe \'View More\' feature is disabled by default, so that only elements that are normally visible are displayed. When the \'View More\' feature is enabled, elements that are normally invisible are also displayed and can be selected and edited.\n\nAn edited web page can be saved as a single HTML file, which can be viewed or re-edited using Firefox or Chrome. An edited web page can also be saved as a PDF file.\n\nClick the \'Preview\' button to see how the edited web page will look when printed. Close the preview window to return to editing.\n\nThere are options to:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 default to enabling display with View More at start.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 default to enabling selection of Text Pieces at start.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 default to enabling display with Web Style at start.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 automatically delete graphics at start.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 change visibility of link URLs (show or hide).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 automatically close Print Edit WE after exiting Preview.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 not ask the user about saving edits when closing an edited web page.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ask the user about leaving an edited web page only if the edits are not saved.\n\nOPTIONS PAGE\n\nThe Print Edit WE Options page can be accessed as follows:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Firefox - On the menu bar select Tools &gt; Add-ons (or press Ctrl+Shift+A), select the Extensions tab, and then click on the Options button.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Chrome - Right-click on the toolbar button, and then select Options.\n\nTOOLBAR BUTTON\n\nAfter installation of Print Edit WE, there will be a new grey and blue \'printer-pencil\' button on the main toolbar.\n\nIf Print Edit WE cannot be used with the current page, the toolbar button will be disabled (greyed-out).\n\nTo start editing the page, click on the Print Edit WE toolbar button and a blue editing \'Edit\' (editing) badge will appear.\n\nTo suspend editing, click on the Print Edit WE toolbar button again, and a red \'Sus\' (suspended) badge will appear. To resume editing, click on the Print Edit WE toolbar button again.\n\nThere is an option to double-click on the toolbar button to close editing.\n\nCONTEXT MENU &amp; BUTTON MENU\n\nTo start editing the page, right-click on the page contents to open the context menu, select the Print Edit WE sub-menu, and then select the \'Start Editing\' menu item.\n\nTo suspend or resume editing of the page, right-click on the page contents to open the context menu, select the Print Edit WE sub-menu, and then select the \'Suspend Editing\' or \'Resume Editing\' menu item.\n\nAs an alternative to using the context menu, right-click on the Print Edit WE toolbar button and use the button menu.\n\nThere is an option to show/hide the Print Edit WE submenu item on the context menu.\n\nPRINT EDIT WE TOOLBAR\n\nThe buttons available on the Print Edit WE toolbar are:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Select - select all or graphic or page-break elements, or re-select elements from previous command.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Deselect - deselect all currently selected elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hide - hide currently selected elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Delete - delete currently selected elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hide Except - hide all elements except those currently selected.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Delete Except - delete all elements except those currently selected, with varying restrictions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Format - apply format properties to currently selected elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Text - edit a text piece or insert new text before or after element.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Undo - undo the action of previous edit command.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Undo All - undo the actions of all previous edit commands.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Save - save web page as a single HTML or PDF file.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Text Pieces - allow selection and editing of individual text pieces.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 View More - view invisible elements in the page.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Web Style - alternately remove or apply CSS print stylesheets.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Preview - open the Print Preview window.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Close - finish editing.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tools - access to the Fix Page Breaks features and to the Options dialog.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Help - show the Help panel.\n\nThe Delete Except button has three menu items:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Restricted - higher level elements retain their size and relative position.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Without Float - higher level elements retain their size and relative position, but cannot float right.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Unrestricted - higher level elements are resized and repositioned freely, but cannot float right.\n\nIn this context, \xe2\x80\x9chigher level elements\xe2\x80\x9d means the ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc) of the currently selected elements.\n\nKEYBOARD SHORTCUTS\n\nTo initiate Print Edit, press Alt+P. To initiate Print Preview when not editing a web page, press Alt+Shift+P. These shortcuts can be reconfigured in the Shortcuts tab of the Print Edit WE Options page.\n\nEach button or menu item on the Print Edit WE toolbar has a keyboard shortcut, which is the letter that is underlined in the name of the button or menu item.\n\nThe other keyboard shortcuts are:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ] - deselect all elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 [ - select previously selected elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 # - apply page breaks before selected elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Up - step up to higher level containing element.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Down - step down to previously highlighted element.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Left - step backwards to preceding element.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Right - step forwards to following element.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Enter - select or deselect highlighted element.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Insert - hide selected elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Delete - delete selected elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Backspace - undo previous edit command.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Escape - close panel or menu - or close Print Preview window\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Home - scroll to top of page.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 End - scroll to bottom of page.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PageUp - scroll up by window height.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PageDown - scroll down by window height.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ctrl+A - select all elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Crtl+P - open Print Preview window.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ctrl+S - save web page as a single HTML file.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ctrl+Z - undo previous edit command.\n\nMOUSE ACTIONS\n\nThe mouse actions are:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Move - move highlight box to highlight element.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Click - select or deselect highlighted element.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Right-Click - inspect format properties for highlighted element.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Drag - select all elements within capture box.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Shift+Drag - select all graphic elements within capture box.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ctrl+Drag - deselect all elements within capture box.\n\nHIGHLIGHT BOX\n\nThe highlight box (solid border) is positioned over an element by moving the mouse over the element. If necessary, the position of the highlight box can be adjusted using the Expand (Up Arrow) and Shrink (Down Arrow) keys.  The element is then selected by clicking the mouse or by pressing the Select (Enter) key.\n\nThe position of the highlight box can also be adjusted and the element selected using the Expand, Shrink and Select buttons in the Inspect panel. \n\nSELECTING ELEMENTS\n\nAn individual element is selected by moving the mouse, so that the highlight box (solid border) is positioned over the element, and then clicking the mouse (or pressing Enter). The highlight box then changes to a selection box (dashed border). Any number of elements can be selected, one after another, before applying an edit command.\n\nAny selected element can be deselected by moving the mouse, so that the highlight box (solid border) is positioned over the selected element, and then clicking the mouse (or pressing Enter). The selection box (dashed border) then disappears.\n\nMultiple elements can be selected together by dragging the mouse to draw a rectangular capture area which encloses the elements. When the mouse is released, all of the elements within the capture area are selected. To select just graphic elements, hold down the Shift key when dragging the mouse.\n\nTo deselect multiple elements, hold down the the Ctrl key when dragging the mouse.\n\nIf the start point of the capture area is within a &lt;frame&gt; or &lt;iframe&gt;, then the capture area can only be dragged within the boundaries of the &lt;frame&gt; or &lt;iframe&gt;.\n\nAll selected elements can be deselected by clicking the Deselect button.\n\nThere are options to:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 make elements still selectable after a Hide command.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 reinstate select boxes after an Undo command.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 show wider borders for the highlight and selection boxes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 shade the background for selection boxes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 snap the capture box start point to the web page edge.\n\nEDITING AND INSERTING TEXT\n\nThe Text command allows a selected piece of text to be edited, or new text to be inserted before or after a selected element or selected piece of text. The Text command button is only enabled when a single element or single piece of text is selected.\n\nNormally, an individual piece of text can only be selected if the Text Pieces feature is enabled. However, when the Text Pieces feature is disabled, any individual pieces of text that have been previously edited will remain selectable and editable.\n\nThe Text popup panel provides a text box where an existing piece of text can be edited or new text can be prepared before being inserted. All of the standard editing keyboard shortcuts (e.g. arrow keys, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V) can be used in the text box.\n\nThere is an option to show line breaks when the Text Pieces feature is enabled.\n\nAPPLYING FORMAT PROPERTIES\n\nThe Format command allows up to twenty-six format properties to be applied to the selected elements. These format properties affect both the layout of the content and its appearance, and can be used to reduce the space that the content occupies on the printed page and to improve its readability.\n\nThe format properties can be applied individually by ticking the checkboxes in the Properties section, or in groups by using the buttons in the Quick Styles section. The value of a format property can be changed by clicking the small arrow buttons next to the property value. Click on the property value to reset it to the default value.\n\nThe Properties section can be shown or hidden by clicking the Show/Hide Properties (down/up chevron) button. The values of all of the format properties can be reset to their default values by clicking the Reset Properties (arrows target) button.\n\nThe format properties can be applied to the selected elements or to the selected elements and their nested sub-elements. The format properties can be restricted (Only or Except) to specific content types (e.g. Blocks or List Items). The Format command can be applied multiple times to the same element.\n\nINSPECTING FORMAT PROPERTIES\n\nThe current format properties for an element can be displayed in the Inspect popup panel. This is displayed by moving the mouse, so that the highlight box (solid border) is positioned over the element, and then right-clicking the mouse.\n\nThe Inspect panel has five buttons (Expand, Shrink, Backwards, Forwards and Select) which allow positioning of the highlight box and selection of the highlighted element.\n\nThere is an option to allow the Inspect panel to be opened when the Format panel is open.\n\nADJUSTING PAGE BREAKS\n\nPage breaks can be applied or avoided using the \'Page Break\' property in the Format panel. \n\nPage breaks can also be applied using the \'Page Break Before\' button in the Format panel or using the hash (#) keyboard shortcut.\n\nAll elements with the \'Page Break\' property set can be selected using the \'Select Page Breaks\' menu item.\n\nThere is an option to default to avoid page breaks inside images.\n\nSAVING AS HTML FILE\n\nThe Save As HTML menu item allows an edited web page to be saved as a single HTML file (including styling, images and fonts) that can be opened and re-edited in Firefox or Chrome.\n\nThere is an option to choose the save action:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Save Basic Items\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Save Standard Items\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Save Custom Items\n\nNote, to use the Save As HTML feature, the Save Page WE extension (version 14.0 or later) must be installed and enabled.\n\nThere are options in Save Page WE to specify which items are saved and to purge elements that have been hidden.\n\nPlease refer to the Save Page WE documentation for more information: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/save-page-we/" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/save-page-we/</a>\n\nSAVING AS PDF FILE\n\nThe Save As PDF menu item allows an edited web page to be saved as a PDF file. This feature is available with Firefox 56 or later on Windows or Linux, and with Firefox 81 or later on Mac OS X.\n\nThe Save As PDF popup panel allows fast configuration of paper size, orientation, scale and background prior to saving the edited web page as a PDF file.\n\nThere are options to configure the paper size, orientation, scale, background, content margins, header/footer margins and header/footer fields for the saved PDF file.\n\nThe page title, page URL, page numbers, date and time, etc can be inserted into the header/footer fields using the following codes:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 &amp;T - Page Title\n\xe2\x80\xa2 &amp;U - Page URL\n\xe2\x80\xa2 &amp;D - Date and Time\n\xe2\x80\xa2 &amp;P - Page Number\n\xe2\x80\xa2 &amp;PT - Page Number and Total Pages\n\nThere are options to specify the saved file name using text or predefined fields and to replace spaces with a user-defined character.\n\nThe saved file name may contain the following predefined fields:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %TITLE% - the document title or if this is empty the same as %FILE%.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %DATE(x)% - the current date in YYYYxMMxDD format, where \'x\' is any character or can be omitted.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %TIME(x)% - the current time in HHxMMxSS format, where \'x\' is any character or can be omitted.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %HOST% - the host name in the page URL.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %HOSTW% - the same as %HOST%, but without the \'www.\' prefix.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %PATH% - the path in the page URL.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %PATHW% - the same as %PATH%, but without the \'.extension\' suffix.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %FILE% - the file name in the last segment of the path in the page URL.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %FILEW% - the same as %FILE%, but without the \'.extension\' suffix.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %QUERY(p)% - the query string in the page URL if \'p\' is omitted, or the value of parameter \'p\'.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 %FRAGMENT% - the fragment string in the page URL.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nPlease e-mail:  dw-dev@gmx.com\n\nLICENSE\n\nDistributed under the GNU General Public License version 2.\nSee LICENCE.txt file and <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/3d6917694df8e9679bcc47a13f1aa376bba1b3b3bfd76531ad656a4c22fcb734/http%3A//www.gnu.org/licenses/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>'",extension,DW-dev,mozilla

HTTP enables visitors to view a website and send information back and forth to the server. HTTPS, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure, is communication through a secure connection. Communications through HTTPS are encrypted by a secure certificate known as an SSL. The encryption prevents third-parties from eavesdropping on communications to and from the server.

Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.</b>\n\n<b>Permission Request Explanations</b>\n- <code>Access your data for all websites</code>: CAD requests this to delete cookies and other site data for all sites\n- <code>Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data</code>: Ability to delete site data by domains.\n- <code>Display notifications to you</code>: Self explanatory.\n- <code>Read and modify privacy settings</code>: <i>This setting has been removed since 3.4.0 and is kept here for historical reasons. </i> Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD "read and modify" permissions, <b>NO MODIFICATIONS</b> are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- <code>Access browser tabs</code>: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\n<b>Main Features</b>\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed (and/or discarded) Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for domains\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist and core settings\n- Clear All Cookies and site data for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site \n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\n<b>Usage</b>\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable "Auto-clean". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle "Auto-clean" in the popup or "Automatic cleaning" in the settings\n3.

This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\n<i>Clean, include open tabs</i>: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\n<i>Clear All Cookies for This Domain</i>: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\n<b>Some things to Note:</b>\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. <b>Enable it in the settings.</b>\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\n- Cleaning site data other than cookies within containers will have unintended side effects due to the current Web Extension API where attempting to clear a site data for one domain on a container will also clear that site data of the same domain on all containers.\n\n<a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/dd43eb177b3cf3f5939751444d022ef8a25f587c4f44539e2139e476f6163188/https%3A//github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete/wiki/Documentation" rel="nofollow"><b>Documentation</b></a>\n\n<a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/71d835a098075ea91e6374366d4646602d987065634d5f19665b0f7224b9cd0a/https%3A//github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete/wiki/FAQ%3A-Common-Questions-and-Issues" rel="nofollow"><b>Troubleshooting</b></a>\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/8bb6a2ae988902360cfb6b0689dd790ca308facc12953ccf2d717502e6e86a7b/https%3A//github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete/issues" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>.

This allows us to derive all relevant JavaScript <code>navigator.*</code> browser/OS identification values from just a single value: The User-Agent value you enter (and a bit of <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/b3906c8e1defd8e5aa777473daf797be85f2e6d4aafd504ba7bdd417e308f928/https%3A//gitlab.com/ntninja/user-agent-switcher/blob/master/utils/uaparser.js" rel="nofollow">magic</a> behind the scenes). Other extensions with a similarly complete level of emulation used to store all these values in huge tables along with the User-Agent value itself, making it very hard to add new entries.\n\n    Doing this kind of emulation without using BrowsCap would be extremely hard for us, as there are only few rules regarding the structure of User-Agent strings and the most interesting part end up in the extremely browser-specific <em>comment section</em> of the string. As such, we consider these extra 3MiB+ of data shipped with the extension a fair price to pay for having almost perfect out-of-the-box emulation of all these values with no extra user configuration required.\n\n    And yes, the BrowsCap data is here to stay and if you cannot cope with the extra size this causes please kindly download a different extension and don\'t down-vote. Other people appreciate this decision even if you don\'t.</li>  <li><strong>Can this extension be installed on Firefox for Android?</strong>\n\n    Unfortunately Mozilla decided to limit support for extensions on their new <em>Fenix</em> browser platform to just a limited set of recommended extensions.

As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there\'s no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it\'s not exactly trivial.\n<ul><li>Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.</li><li>Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.</li><li>Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.</li><li>Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).</li></ul>\n<b>Privacy Policy</b>\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don\'t find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\n<b>Firefox related notes</b>\n\n<ul><li>To import styles from Stylish add-on please read <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/f289ded069b26e9cb643dbf87a1df122a9b4bca69e10c5ada4005cf9823cffa6/https%3A//github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ%23how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus</a></li><li>Stylus doesn\'t apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there\'s no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don\'t plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/99aeca80c40fd0f4e330b6b3a73c5e31b5f2fee715024cf09aaaa9351906f4f9/https%3A//github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI</a></li><li>Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we\'ve kept the "beta" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.</li></ul>'",extension,"Stylus Team",mozilla
819184,https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gesturefy/,b'Gesturefy',"b'Gesturefy is a pure mouse gesture extension, which means it\'s only suited for mice and not touchpads. "What\'s a mouse gesture?" you might ask yourself. Well, mouse gestures are like keyboard shortcuts, only for your mouse. Instead of pressing a bunch of keys, you simply move your mouse in a certain manner to execute commands and actions. Mouse gestures can be more natural and convenient than keyboard shortcuts and thus are also suitable for casual users. Wait, is that a mouse in your hand? Come and try it out :)\n\n<b>Features:</b>\n<ul>    <li>Mouse gestures (moving the mouse while holding the left, middle, or right button)</li>    <li>More than 80 different predefined commands</li>    <li>Provides special commands like popup, user script, multi purpose and cross add-on command</li>    <li>Customizable gesture trace and status information style</li>    <li>Rocker gestures (left-click while holding the right mouse button and vice versa)</li>    <li>Wheel gestures (scroll wheel while holding the left, middle, or right button)</li>    <li>Multilingual, thanks to volunteers on <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/d3e219e5f34e582222acfb135a156bf9ab20077b4e4b2303469b9c5d2bdf062a/https%3A//crowdin.com/project/gesturefy" rel="nofollow">Crowdin</a></li>    <li>Light, dark and highcontrast theme</li></ul>\n<b>Limitations:</b>\n<ul>    <li>Gesturefy does not work on Mozilla related pages like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org" rel="nofollow">addons.mozilla.org</a>, internal pages like about:addons or other add-on option pages (e.g. moz-extension://*).

839767,https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/,b'ClearURLs',"b'This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browsing through the Internet.\n\nMany websites use tracking elements in the URL (e.g. <i><a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/344a6fe9b42939cfdf2571731f5ee894cd01637677e73cc9ffc0572f9865d2d8/https%3A//example.com%3Futm_source=newsletter1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=sale" rel="nofollow">https://example.com?utm_source=newsletter1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=sale</a></i>)  to mark your online activity. All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed\xe2\x80\x94that is exactly what ClearURLs does. \n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: <i><a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/63722ba4e0d6cec64bf0de7f26d372dba8d8bd4e2fc4e276c65050625169806f/https%3A//www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb%3F__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=tea&amp;pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&amp;pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&amp;pd_rd_w=1pcKM&amp;pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&amp;pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&amp;pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&amp;qid=1517757263&amp;rnid=2914120011" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=\xc3\x85M\xc3\x85\xc5\xbd\xc3\x95\xc3\x91&amp;keywords=tea&amp;pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&amp;pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&amp;pd_rd_w=1pcKM&amp;pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&amp;pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&amp;pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&amp;qid=1517757263&amp;rnid=2914120011</a></i>\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code.

In order to make this connection, a separate patch is provided in GitHub. Please download and install this patch from: <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/1bee2c8805b0ccbd22e1b38514090530228512547e4fc81b26bc38211ba8ccb4/https%3A//github.com/alexmarcoo/open-in-native-client/releases" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/alexmarcoo/open-in-native-client/releases</a>\n\nFollow the instructions in the above GitHub page to download and install the related patch to your system. After installing, the "Open in PDF Viewer" addon in your browser can communicate with PDF viewer on your machine (Window, Linux or Mac). \n\nDefault option for the PDF viewer is adobe acrobat reader. In windows 10, the default location for Adobe Acrobat is "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Acrobat Reader DC\\Reader\\AcroRd32.exe". If you have a different OS, or if you installed Adobe Acrobat in a different folder, please adjust the field accordingly. You can change this from the options page. \n\nThere is also an input field which you can add arguments for the viewer. For example, to open PDF as full-screen or without toolbar. Please note that, if you change the PDF viewer make sure to change the input arguments as well. Each PDF viewer has its own arguments to operate. If you keep Adobe as the default PDF viewer, please visit <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/efae4f0bb021117804b65a8deb0ad4673c915507b4fd59137228c8d4fe9e1900/http%3A//www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> page to get more info about input arguments.\n\nIn order to operate with this addon, please right-click on any link (a link to a PDF document) and then click on - Open and Download with PDF Viewer - item from the context-menu. The PDF file will first be "downloaded" and then "opened" in a default PDF viewer (the one which is set in the options page). Please note that, the PDF file will be downloaded in the "default" download folder in your machine.\n\nNote 2: before using the addon, please open the option\'s page and make sure the path to the PDF viewer is correct based on your Operating System.\n\nIn order to report any bug, please fill the bug report form in the addon\'s <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/0047bf806d0d435c5dfdbdbf75452574104a36662b317b1e475ba9dd20ddc68c/http%3A//mybrowseraddon.com/open-in-pdf.html" rel="nofollow">homepage</a>.'",extension,Alex,mozilla

Think of it as configure once and forget solution. With SmartProxy you don\'t need to change your proxy manually or turn it on and off.

After that, when you visit that specific website, SmartProxy will act and all you data for that website will be transferred though the proxy, without you doing anything.\n\n<strong>Please note that:</strong>\n\xf0\x9f\x9a\xab SmartProxy <strong>does not</strong> provide any type of proxy servers.\n\xf0\x9f\x91\x80 SmartProxy <strong>does not</strong> track you in any way.\n\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f SmartProxy is completely ad free in any way.\n\n<strong>SmartProxy</strong>\nIt uses patterns to automatically define rules to proxify your web experience.

However, a similar option is reimplemented in the addon itself in order to keep only the protected cookies when restarting the browser.\n\n\n<strong>What is "Delete Current Site Local Storage" on the popup menu?</strong>\n\nThis item allows a user to delete LocalStorage keys from the viewed page.\n\nThe LocalStorage is a quite new feature of HTML5 that allows developers to create data in your browser using JavaScript. Cookies are just one type of storage among others.\nYou will also find the term "SessionStorage", a LocalStorage where data is stored temporarily (deleted on browser restart), but the important thing is that LocalStorage is persistent, and cleared only at the discretion of the visited websites.\nYou may erase all of the LocalStorage store by following the procedure described in the <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/187147b9a832b5c48266351cde5462e6240afb54ea7143367e854989d2572fe2/https%3A//support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored%23w_delete-all-cookies" rel="nofollow">documentation of Firefox</a>, and by selecting "Offline Website Data".\n\nFrom the point of view of privacy and security:\n\nThis kind of persistant data (even after clearing cache), was invented to store small data allowing the operation of online applications, but also offers new and better accurate ways of tracking thanks to the memorization of private or identifying data.\n\n\n<strong>Support &amp; source code</strong>\n\nThe extension is still in development with the launch of Firefox Quantum; questions, bug reports and feature requests are open on the <a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/e9b8bddfaf4cd66aa22117ff5c83cc48d4edd320879c57a04fc4f84f8ec9e2d4/https%3A//github.com/ysard/cookie-quick-manager/issues" rel="nofollow">GitHub repository</a>.\n\n\n<strong>License</strong>\n\n<a href="https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/b3f3071ef69cdae4b3f423d8472bb6fbc2f1690c1972c905e537edade59c5fcf/https%3A//github.com/ysard/cookie-quick-manager/blob/master/LICENSE" rel="nofollow">GPLv3</a>.'",extension,Ysard,mozilla

Supports PDF.  Supports EPUB (via the excellent <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/epubreader/" rel="nofollow">EPUBReader</a> extension). \n\nRead Aloud is a Firefox extension that uses text-to-speech technology to convert webpage text to audio.  It works on a variety of websites, including news sites, blogs, fan fiction, publications, textbooks, school and class websites, online universities and course materials.\n\nRead Aloud is aimed at users who prefer to listen to content instead of reading, people with dyslexia or other learning disabilities, children learning to read, or simply to provide users with alternative way to consume web content.\n\nRead Aloud allows you to select from a variety of text-to-speech voices, including those provided natively by the browser, as well as by text-to-speech cloud service providers such as Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson, and Microsoft.  Some of the cloud-based voices may require additional in-app purchase to enable.\n\nRecent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence has enabled very high-quality speech synthesis.  Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly voices, for example, use bleeding edge technology to provide life-like synthetic speech that is close to that of human speech.  Read Aloud allows you to use your own Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services account to enable these voices.\n\nTo use Read Aloud, simply navigate to the web page you want to read, then click the Read Aloud icon on the Firefox menu.  In addition, the shortcut keys ALT-P, ALT-O, ALT-Comma, and ALT-Period can be used to Play/Pause, Stop, Rewind, and Forward, respectively.  You may select the text you want to read before activating the extension.  Right clicking on the selected text will provide you with yet another context-menu option to activate Read Aloud.\n\nTo change the voice, reading speed, pitch, or enable text highlighting, go to the Options page either by right clicking on the Read Aloud icon and choose Options, or by clicking the Gear button on the extension popup (you\'ll need to stop playback to see the Gear button).\n\n<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>\n\n<i>Personal information</i>\nIf you use one of the Premium Voices, you\'ll be asked to sign in to your Google account and grant Read Aloud access to your basic user profile, which includes name and email address. We require this information for usage tracking, since the Premium Voices requires making a purchase when usage exceeds the monthly free tier. If you don\'t use the Premium Voices, you don\'t need to sign in, and no information is collected.\n\n<i>Browsing history</i>\nWe do not track the user\'s browsing history. We realize the importance of privacy, so we make sure our extensions require only the minimum set of browser permissions to operate.  In particular, during installation, it does not ask for the "Read your browsing history" or the "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit" permissions, both of which could be used to track the user\'s browsing history.\n\n<i>Text converted to speech</i>\nWhen you select one of the standard text-to-speech voices, the speech synthesis occurs locally on your computer and is never sent to the internet. And neither the input text nor the synthesized speech are saved or stored on your computer.\n\nWhen you select one of the premium text-to-speech voices, the input text is sent to our cloud server for synthesis. The server may use your anonymized IP address and User-Agent data for purpose of analytics, abuse management, and service improvement. The server may cache the input text, as well as the synthesized speech, for short amounts of time as part of its normal operation; it does not save them to any type of permanent storage.\n\n<i>Geolocation</i>\nIf you select a voice that is synthesized on our server, your anonymized IP address may be used for geolocation for analytics purposes.\n\n<i>Issue reporting and contact forms</i>\nIf you use the in-app report-issue function or use the contact form on our support website, your comments and information may be kept in our support database for a maximum of 6 months.\n\n<i>Analytics</i>\nThe extensions use Firefox Addons Store\'s built-in analytics.
